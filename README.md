Block Blitz was a classic old BBC Micro game which was published in Beebug magazine in 1984 and was then a staple in game compilation floppies that got shared around (this was long before the internet made sharing easy). 

This Playdate remake aims to copy the original precisely in a single main.lua file.

The game used BBC Micro Mode 5 graphics, 160x256 pixels, and had a 20x32 grid of 8x8 graphics, but the 8x8 graphics had a 2:1 ratio, they weren't square, so for our purposes 16x8.
